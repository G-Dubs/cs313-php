After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:  https://vast-bastion-22731.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):  https://github.com/G-Dubs/cs313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

	There is a color changing button that works when you click it.  There are words that become highlighted when you hover over them. There is a link that brings you 
	to another page.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

	I wanted to link my page of coming soon to this page, but I haven't created it yet.  I wanted the list of colors to open in a different tab, but I forgot how to do
	that.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

	I realized the heroku server is live.  I was showing my friends the websites that I have made (both by myself and with Tyler).  I thought that was really cool!

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?

	Get lets you to request data from a server, and Post lets you send a form to a server.  Each of these should be used when trying to do either of those things.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

	3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

	I reused a lot of the code from our team activity, but it still meets the requirements of the homepage assignment.  I did put some more effort to change it up a
	little bit.  I also had trouble with some of the plugins that I installed.  VS Code deletes any non-PHP files when I try to save them.
